# TriviaGame
This trivia game uses an array of objects to display a quiz form to the user. The user will have 30 seconds to input all their answers via radio buttons and submit. If the user does not answer all the questions in the allotted time, the game ends and their score is tallied. 
Once the user answers all the questions, or the timer runs out, a screen will display the amount of questions the user got correct, wrong, or unanswered. 
The user will have the option to start the game over...or leave if they choose.
